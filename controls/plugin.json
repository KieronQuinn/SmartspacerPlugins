	"description": "**Important: THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES ROOT**\n\nThe Device Controls Plugin for Smartspacer allows you to put your home controls directly on the Smartspace, to quickly view their statuses and perform actions without having to open any other app.\n\nFeatures:\n- Device Control Target to show the full status of and perform actions on a Control\n- Device Control Complication to show a short status of and perform actions on a Control\n- Device Control Requirement to show/hide the Target/Complication depending on the state of a Control\n- Custom Title, Subtitle & Icon for the Target and Complication, allowing full customisation of how your Control should show in Smartspace\n- Options for which action to perform on tap, including opening straight to the Control provider app or showing all Device Controls\n\n**Note:** Due to an Android System issue, this plugin may occasionally force stop the Control provider app to unblock it, since the issue causes them to get stuck sometimes. Most of the time, this will only be noticeable as a slight delay of running the action, but if the Control provider app needs to be always running, this may cause issues. For this reason, do not use this plugin with automation apps like Tasker, instead use the Tasker plugin.",
