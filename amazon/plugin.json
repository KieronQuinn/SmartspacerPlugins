	"changelog": "v2.0.1\n\n- Fixed an issue where delivered orders would sometimes not show in Smartspace as delivered\n\nv2.0\n\nVersion 2.0 of the Amazon plugin is a total rewrite, to resolve the issue of being logged out. It has some changes to how order tracking works:\n\n- When an order is dispatched, it will not automatically get live delivery tracking. Automatic loading of the tracking IDs was triggering Amazon's bot detection. As a result, when a new dispatched order is detected you will be sent a notification to link the delivery - this is quite simple, it's just a couple of taps and the app will do the rest\n- The plugin now has a UI to view currently tracked and recent orders\n\nDelivery live GPS tracking is now supported anywhere where Amazon's website does. More Amazon domains are also supported, as well as better handling of orders with multiple shipments. \n\nYou will be logged out when updating (if you were somehow still logged in), this is normal. Log in once more and you should not be logged out when a new order comes in anymore.",
